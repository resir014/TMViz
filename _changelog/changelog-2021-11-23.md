- <span class="feature--changed">Changed</span> TMVIZ just got a performance boost! Not much has changed visually, but under the hood, there's a major rework in how gamepads are rendered. This makes the overlay much less demanding in terms of render count, which (hopefully) results in way less memory usage + freezing on OBS. For the technically-minded, here's a [simple architecture diagram](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5663877/142922932-dbd4ef65-92fe-43a0-bf16-b1c7632d8d27.png) of the new overlay. (Thanks to [@heyImMapleLeaf](https://twitter.com/heyImMapleLeaf) for their help with performance debugging! ðŸ’™)
